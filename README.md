## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- JavaScript

### What I learned

This was my first challenge with the "junior" difficulty level. I tried to work on a combination of layout types and used flex for some aspects and grid for others. This project was very beneficial to my CSS skills. In relation to JavaScript, it was very similar to the previous email sign-up challenge I did, and I was very glad that I remembered the concepts and was able to recreate it! 

### Continued development

I'm still working on figuring out what works best for me when it comes to designing the layout. For some projects, I feel like I've got a system that works perfectly. For others, it feels like I have no idea what I'm doing or where to start. More practice is key!
